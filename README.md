I have built this application (Instagram clone) using React.js (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Google Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

Features such as like/unlike and comment on a post are included, and users can also follow/unfollow other each other to view posts.

Tech stack used: React, Tailwiind-CSS, Google Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
