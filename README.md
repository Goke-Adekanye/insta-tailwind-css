I have built this application (Instagram clone) using React.js (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Google Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

Features

- Supports authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication.
- Can create new account using Signup.
- Can follow other profiles on the application.
- Can like and comment posts.
- Can view any profile and see the posts which the profile owner has posted.
- fully responsive

Tech stack used: React, Tailwiind-CSS, Google Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
